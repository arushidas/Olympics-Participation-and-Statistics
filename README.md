Olympics Participation and Insightful Statistics from 1896-2014 using a Kaggle Dataset


### Introduction:
The project focuses on analyzing historical data of the Olympic Games to answer four research questions related to male and female participation, home-field advantage, medal counts by country, and the popularity of Olympic sports. The Olympic Games are a significant global event with economic, political, and social implications. The dataset used is the publicly accessible Olympic Sports and Medals Dataset from Kaggle, which is considered credible as it is provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Gender inequality in sports and the lack of media coverage for female athletes are also highlighted.

The project utilizes the Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896-2014 Dataset, which is open-sourced and provided by the IOC Research and Reference Service. The dataset includes information on various attributes related to Olympic sports and medals.

### Visualization Techniques:
The project employs different visualizations to present the analyzed data effectively. These include radial bar plots to compare male and female participation in the Olympics, an area chart to explore the home-field advantage, a choropleth map to depict medal counts by country, and donut charts to showcase the popularity of Olympic sports and disciplines.

### Research Gaps:
The project addresses research gaps in understanding the changes in male and female participation over the years, the existence of a home-field advantage in the Olympics, the popularity of different Olympic sports in different regions while also highlighting the issue of gender inequality in sports and the lack of media coverage for female athletes.

### Conclusion:
The project provides valuable insights into the historical data of the Olympic Games. It reveals trends in male and female participation, suggests the existence of a home-field advantage, presents the medal counts for different countries, and showcases the popularity of Olympic sports. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the Olympics and shed light on gender disparities in sports. Further research could explore additional factors influencing performance and analyze the impact of media coverage on female athletes.
